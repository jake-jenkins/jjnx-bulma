In 2003 during Jake’s time at university, a group of friends identified a need for an online peer support network for Lesbian, Gay. Bisexual and Trans\* students. WayGay.co.uk was an online support forum allowing users to sign up, post stories of their experience and support others facing similar challenges. It also helped to unite university groups.

This was at a time when social media was not in existance. WayGay.co.uk users managed to post over 100,000 messages to the site, and was used by several UK university groups.

The project was awarded lottery funding from the Millenium Commision to help grow the site. The service briefly enjoyed support from the NUS LGBT campaign. Https://waygay.co.uk

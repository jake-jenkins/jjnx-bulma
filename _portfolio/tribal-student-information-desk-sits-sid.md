Tribal’s Student Information Desk is an enquiry management software systems. The system allows students to view frequently asked questions (FAQs) and to create a help call, appointment booking and case management.

HTML and CSS tweaks, email template etc were built for the university to match the brand identity and tweak the system to meet the requirements.

Additional work was undertaken on single sign on, and working with another developer to build an interface to ensure real time data was available within the system.
